    Law enforcement officers are required to write reports for any notable action in the course of their day.<br>
    These reports are often used in court, and as such, need to be thorough, professional documents that
    contain all relevant information to potential future investigation.<br>
    This process is often iterative, with the officer's superior requesting revisions to include more detail,
    or rephrase some aspect of the scenario. <br>
    This tool aims to reduce writing time, revision cycles, and risk of missed information, including the
    reasoning of an officer if rules or departmental guidelines were violated.
