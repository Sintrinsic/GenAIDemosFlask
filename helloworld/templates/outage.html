                    Law enforcement officers are required to write reports for any notable action in the course of their day.<br>
                    These reports are often used in court, and as such, need to be thorough, professional documents that
                    contain all relevant information to potential future investigation.<br>
                    This process is often iterative, with the officer's superior requesting revisions to include more detail,
                    or rephrase some aspect of the scenario. <br>
                    This tool aims to reduce writing time, revision cycles, and risk of missed information, including the
                    reasoning of an officer if rules or departmental guidelines were violated.
